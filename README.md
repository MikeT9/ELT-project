GME Stock values and Reddit comment frequency 
Team: Erin O'Brien, Fatima Shami & Michael Thomas

First pulled posts from wallstreetbets from reddit using API, focusing on topics mentioning GME only and ignoring the comment data. 
Then used Yahoo Finance API wrapper to pull the opening and closing values for the GME.
We joined the data based on each week as the stock market Is closed on the weekend. The two data bases were converged in SQL lite.
